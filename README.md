## Assignment  Goal: This lab was designed to introduce and demonstrate how to use an ArrayList. 

## Project Description:
Create a method that will receive an integer parameter and then return an ArrayList that contains all of the numberâ€™s factors, excluding 1 and itself.  Create a 2nd method that will remove all numbers from its ArrayList parameter that are not composite numbers.  Composite numbers are divisible by 1, itself, and must have at least 1 other positive factor.  You will need to use % to determine if a number is a factor.
